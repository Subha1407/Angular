    <!-- course is an @Input() property of the child component course-card. The square brackets is property binding. They bind the input property course to the value of 
    the property coreCourse. This sends the value of coreCourse to the child component. Property binding gets the value from the TypeScript file in the same component as the HTML 
    template file. when using property binding with an input property, the binding is set in the parent component's HTML template file. The input proerpty is in square brackets, 
    and the property with the value for the input property is a proparty in the parent component's TypeScript file. -->

    <!-- parentheses denote an event. It can be a standard event such as click or keyup, or it can be a custom event, such as here - courseSelected. The method that occurs upon the event 
    is found in the current component's TypeScript file. -->

    <!-- A custom event can be emitted from a child component using the @Output decorator. The event name comes from the child component's TypeScript file. The $event must be passed in
    as a parameter to the nethod being run.  -->
